/**
 * Java age calculator.
 * 
 * This application is a demonstration of some basic Java functionality.  
 *
 * To figure out where the Calendar class was, ie. java.util.Calendar, I used
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/, which is the java API reference.
 * This reference lists all of the classes in the Java SDK, and it will help you
 * learn where things are, and what you can do with them.   If you use an IDE
 * to start programming, you normally miss out on this step, as the idea will
 * auto complete the text for you.  While this is much easier to do, and you 
 * can produce products much, much faster, you rob something from the guy just 
 * starting programming, the ability to program independently of an IDE.
 *
 * Please let me know any questions you have, I will be happy to help!
